## Title: Comparative Study of Spatial and Non-spatial Modelling in Price Prediction
### A Case Study of Airbnb Price Prediction in Amsterdam

This repository contains the code and data associated with the paper titled "A Comparative Study of Spatial and Non-spatial Modelling in Price Prediction: A Case Study of Airbnb Price Prediction in Amsterdam." The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing Airbnb prices in Amsterdam and compares the effectiveness of spatial and non-spatial models in predicting these prices.

## Introduction
In recent years, the sharing economy and peer-to-peer activities have gained significant popularity, with Airbnb being a prominent example. As Airbnb continues to grow, concerns about its impact on local economies and housing prices have arisen. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence Airbnb prices becomes crucial for policymakers and the housing market.

This study focuses on predicting the price of Airbnb listings in Amsterdam by analyzing various 'neighbourhood variables' using two models: the Hedonic Price Model (HPM) and the Globally Weighted Regression (GWR) model. The HPM is a global model that calculates the transactional price based on intrinsic attributes, while the GWR model accounts for local variation and spatial dependency.
